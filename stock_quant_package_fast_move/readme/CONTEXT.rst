Imagine that you need to transfer different packages between different locations in your warehouse.

Regular Odoo flow looks like this:

- Go to the "Inventory -> Overview" and select an operation type (eg 'Internal Transfer')
- Create a corresponding picking 
- Add packages if 'Move Entire Packages' is enabled or add all the package products
- Set quantities done
- Validate


However if you are working with packages you will primary operate from the "Packages" menu.

And it would be much convenient if you could move packages directly from this menu.

This is what this module is designed for.
