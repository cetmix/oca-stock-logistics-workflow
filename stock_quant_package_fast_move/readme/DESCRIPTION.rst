This module simplifies package movement between different warehouse locations. 

You can simply select several packages and use a wizard that will perform all the underlying inventory operations.

NB: this module depends on the `Stock Picking Move Package to Another Package <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-workflow/stock_picking_move_package_to_package>`_ module.
You should configure it properly in case you want to use the 'destination package' option.
